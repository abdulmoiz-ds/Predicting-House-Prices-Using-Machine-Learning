# Predicting-House-Prices-Using-Machine-Learning
Learn how to predict house prices using machine learning. Follow our step-by-step guide and use the Random Forest Regression algorithm in Python to build a model that can accurately predict house prices.

This project is an implementation of a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location, and other relevant factors.

## Steps to run the project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

  `git clone https://github.com/your_username/predicting-house-prices.git`

2. Install the necessary libraries by running the following command:

  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Download the dataset from source and place it in the data folder.
4. Open the Jupyter notebook predicting-house-prices.ipynb in your preferred environment.
5. Run each cell in the notebook to train the machine learning model and predict house prices.
